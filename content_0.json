        "content": "​The Avatar Medicine Forum promotes the concept of virtual and physical avatars for patient therapy. Let everyone understand that avatar medicine may reduce the risks that patients need to bear during the treatment process, and it can overcome the limitations of distance and time. The advanced technologies include organoids, model organisms, big data, metaverse, etc. The general public can understand from a new perspective that these technologies have the potential to replace patients themselves and reduce medical risks. At the same time, the forum connects academic and industrial circles, so that potential technologies and products can be demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\u0014\r\n\r\nThis forum invites heavyweight speakers from industry, government, academia, and research circles to share with us the changes and evolution of avatar medicine brought by the post-epidemic era. It is hoped that in the near future, through big data, AI, AR/VR/XR or NFT, virtual avatars can be realized in clinical and teaching.",
